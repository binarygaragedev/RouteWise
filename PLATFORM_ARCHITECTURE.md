## How It All Works Together

### 🔄 Complete Ride Flow:

1. **Passenger** (Dashboard):
   - Opens `/dashboard`
   - Requests ride with pickup/destination
   - AI Consent Agent negotiates data permissions
   - AI Ride Preparation Agent analyzes route, weather, preferences

2. **Driver** (Driver Dashboard):
   - Opens `/driver-dashboard` 
   - Sees ride request notification
   - Reviews AI-generated ride insights
   - Accepts ride

3. **During Ride** (All Platforms):
   - AI Safety Monitoring Agent tracks both users
   - Real-time updates to passenger, driver, and admin dashboards
   - Emergency alerts sent to Emergency Operations Center if needed

4. **Admin** (Admin Panel):
   - Monitors ride progress on `/admin`
   - Receives AI safety alerts
   - Can intervene if necessary

### 🤖 AI Agent Interactions:

- **Consent Negotiation**: Runs between passenger and driver
- **Ride Preparation**: Analyzes for driver optimization
- **Safety Monitoring**: Continuously monitors during ride
- **Emergency Response**: Triggers alerts to operations center
