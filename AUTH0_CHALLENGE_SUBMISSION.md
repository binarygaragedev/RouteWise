## How I Used Auth0 for AI Agents

Auth0 for AI Agents is the security backbone that makes RouteWise AI both powerful and safe. Here's how each Auth0 feature enhances the platform:

### üîê 1. User Authentication & Role-Based Access

```typescript
// lib/auth0.ts - Secure user authentication with role separation
export async function requireAuth(request: Request, requiredRole?: string) {
  const token = await getAccessToken();
  const user = await getUserInfo(token);
  
  if (requiredRole && user.role !== requiredRole) {
    throw new Error(`Access denied. Required role: ${requiredRole}`);
  }
  
  return { user, token };
}
```

**Implementation:**
- **Driver Authentication**: Drivers authenticate through Auth0 with driver-specific scopes
- **Passenger Authentication**: Passengers get passenger-specific permissions
- **Role Isolation**: Each role has distinct UI, features, and AI agent behaviors
- **Session Management**: Secure token handling for persistent sessions

### üîë 2. Token Vault for Secure API Access

```typescript
// lib/tokenVault.ts - AI agents access external APIs securely
export class TokenVault {
  async getSpotifyToken(userId: string): Promise<string> {
    // Retrieve user's Spotify token from Auth0 Token Vault
    const vaultToken = await auth0Management.getTokenVault(userId, 'spotify');
    return vaultToken.access_token;
  }
  
  async secureAPICall(userId: string, service: string, endpoint: string) {
    const token = await this.getToken(userId, service);
    // Make authenticated API call on user's behalf
  }
}
```

**Secured External Integrations:**
- **üéµ Spotify API**: Access user's music preferences securely
- **üó∫Ô∏è Google Maps API**: Route optimization with user's location data
- **üå§Ô∏è Weather API**: Contextual weather information
- **üì± Emergency Services**: Safety monitoring and alerts

**Token Vault Benefits:**
- **Zero Trust Architecture**: AI agents never store user credentials
- **Granular Permissions**: Each agent gets only necessary API access
- **Automatic Refresh**: Token rotation handled transparently
- **Audit Trail**: Complete logging of all agent API interactions

### üõ°Ô∏è 3. Fine-Grained Agent Authorization

```typescript
// agents/BaseAgent.ts - Permission-aware AI agent base class
export abstract class BaseAgent {
  constructor(
    protected userId: string,
    protected authToken: string,
    protected permissions: string[]
  ) {}
  
  protected async checkPermission(action: string): Promise<void> {
    if (!this.permissions.includes(action)) {
      await this.logSecurityEvent('PERMISSION_DENIED', action);
      throw new Error(`Agent lacks permission: ${action}`);
    }
  }
  
  protected async secureAPICall(service: string, endpoint: string) {
    await this.checkPermission(`api:${service}`);
    const token = await this.tokenVault.getToken(this.userId, service);
    // Proceed with authenticated call
  }
}
```

**Agent-Specific Permissions:**
- **Route Optimization Agent**: Maps API, traffic data access
- **Safety Monitoring Agent**: Emergency services, location tracking
- **Experience Agent**: Music APIs, preference management
- **Driver Assistance Agent**: Earnings data, passenger insights

### üîç 4. RAG Pipeline Authorization

```typescript
// Enhanced knowledge access control for AI responses
export class SecureRAGPipeline {
  async queryKnowledge(userId: string, query: string, context: string) {
    // Check user's access level to different knowledge bases
    const allowedSources = await this.getUserKnowledgePermissions(userId);
    
    // Filter knowledge sources based on user permissions
    const filteredSources = this.knowledgeBases.filter(kb => 
      allowedSources.includes(kb.category)
    );
    
    // Generate contextually appropriate and authorized responses
    return await this.generateResponse(query, filteredSources, context);
  }
}
```

**Knowledge Access Control:**
- **Personal Data**: Only user's own preferences and history
- **Public Information**: General traffic, weather, safety data
- **Driver Data**: Earnings, vehicle information (driver role only)
- **Emergency Data**: Safety protocols (authorized agents only)

### üìä 5. Comprehensive Audit and Monitoring

```typescript
// Complete audit trail for all AI agent actions
export async function logAgentAction(
  agentType: string,
  userId: string,
  action: string,
  data: any,
  result: 'success' | 'failure'
) {
  await auth0.audit.log({
    actor: `ai-agent:${agentType}`,
    user_id: userId,
    action: action,
    details: data,
    result: result,
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
    ip_address: getClientIP(),
    user_agent: 'RouteWise-AI-Agent/1.0'
  });
}
```

**Monitoring Capabilities:**
- **Real-time Alerts**: Suspicious AI agent behavior detection
- **Permission Tracking**: All agent permission checks logged
- **API Usage Monitoring**: External service calls tracked per user
- **Security Events**: Failed authentication attempts, permission denials

### üéØ 6. Context-Aware Security
