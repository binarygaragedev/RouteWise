## 🚀 Quick Start (After Copying All Files)

### Step 1: Install Dependencies
```bash
cd C:\projects\sample\routewise-ai
npm install
```

### Step 2: Configure Environment
```bash
copy .env.example .env.local
# Edit .env.local with your Auth0, OpenAI, Spotify credentials
```

### Step 3: Set Up Auth0
1. Go to https://auth0.com and create account
2. Create a "Regular Web Application"
3. Create a "Machine to Machine Application" for agents
4. Copy credentials to `.env.local`

### Step 4: Run Demo
```bash
npm run demo
```

Expected output:
```
🚗 ROUTEWISE AI - AGENT DEMO 🤖

DEMO 1: Ride Preparation Agent
================================
🤖 Ride Preparation Agent activated
✓ Agent authenticated
✓ Permissions checked (granted: music, route | denied: conversation, climate)
✓ Context gathered from 2 sources
✓ AI insights generated
✓ Actions executed

✅ AGENT EXECUTION SUCCESSFUL
```

## 🎯 Priority: What to Copy First

If you're short on time, copy in this order:

1. **agents/RidePreparationAgent.ts** ⭐ CRITICAL
   - This is the star of the show
   - Demonstrates all Auth0 features

2. **scripts/demo.ts** ⭐ IMPORTANT
   - Run this to see everything work
   - Great for the video demo

3. **README.md** ⭐ IMPORTANT
   - Full project documentation
   - For your DEV.to post

4. **app/api/agent/prepare-ride/route.ts**
   - API endpoint for the main agent

5. **agents/ConsentNegotiationAgent.ts**
   - Shows dynamic permissions

6. **agents/SafetyMonitoringAgent.ts**
   - Emergency override demo

7. **QUICKSTART.md**
   - Implementation guide

---

## 💡 How to Find and Copy Artifacts

1. **Scroll up** in this conversation
2. **Look for code blocks** with titles like:
   - `agents/RidePreparationAgent.ts`
   - `scripts/demo.ts`
   - etc.
3. **Click to expand** the artifact
4. **Copy all the code**
5. **Create the file** in the correct location
6. **Paste** the code

## 🔥 What Makes This Win the Challenge

### ✅ All Auth0 Features Demonstrated:
- **User Authentication**: Auth0 Universal Login
- **Agent Authentication**: M2M tokens for AI agents
- **Token Vault**: Secure Spotify OAuth token storage
- **Fine-Grained Authorization**: Per-preference consent control
- **Audit Logging**: Complete compliance trail
- **RAG with Auth**: AI respects permission boundaries

### ✅ Real AI Agents:
- **Autonomous**: Agents make decisions without human input
- **Multi-API**: Call Spotify, Maps, Weather, OpenAI
- **Secure**: All API access via Auth0 Token Vault
- **Auditable**: Every action logged

### ✅ Solves Real Problem:
- Bad rideshare experiences (everyone relates)
- Privacy concerns with AI (hot topic)
- Shows AI can be powerful AND respectful

## 🎬 Demo Video Script (Use This!)

**Opening (30 sec)**
```
"This is RouteWise AI - ridesharing with AI agents that 
respect your privacy, secured by Auth0."
```

**Show Auth0 Dashboard (30 sec)**
```
"Every agent authenticates with M2M tokens. The Token Vault 
securely stores Spotify credentials. Fine-grained permissions 
control what each driver can see."
```

**Live Demo (2 min)**
```
"Watch: Verified driver gets full access. New driver gets 
limited access. Auth0 enforces this automatically.

When the agent needs Spotify data, it uses Token Vault - no 
credentials in our code.

Everything is logged for compliance."
```

**Emergency Demo (1 min)**
```
"Panic button pressed! Safety agent overrides permissions, 
accesses emergency contact, alerts 911. All logged in Auth0."
```

---

## 📝 DEV.to Post Outline

Use the README.md as your base. Add:
- Screenshots of Auth0 dashboard
- Code snippets showing Token Vault usage
- Video demo link
- Live demo link (deploy to Vercel)

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "Cannot find module errors"
```bash
npm install
```

### "Auth0 authentication failed"
Check `.env.local` has correct credentials from Auth0 dashboard

### "OpenAI API error"
Add valid `OPENAI_API_KEY` to `.env.local`

### "Demo script fails"
Make sure you copied all agent files from artifacts
