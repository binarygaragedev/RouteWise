   AUTH0_ISSUER_BASE_URL=https://your-tenant.auth0.com
   AUTH0_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
   AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
   SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-url
   SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-key
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-key
   GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your-maps-key
   SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your-spotify-id
   SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your-spotify-secret
   WEATHER_API_KEY=your-weather-key
   ```
